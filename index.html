        Curious souls, we sought to grow, <br/>
        signed up for the course, and our conversation flowed. <br/>
        You wavered on flights, unsure if you'd stay, <br/>
        while advice from others pulled both ways. <br/>
        Some said go, and some said stay, <br/>
        but I asked what would brighten your way. <br/>
        With all I'd read, I could clearly see— <br/>
        only you knew what was right to be. <br/>
        In that moment, it came to you; <br/>
        you found the answer, clear and true. <br/>

            The silence of my room roared loud, <br/> 
            filled with cars, children, and booming loneliness—  <br/>
            but not with you.  <br/><br/>

            The air was thick with scents—  <br/>
            leaves, rain, and my bleeding heart—  <br/>
            but not with yours.  <br/><br/>

            The walls pressed hard, unyielding,  <br/>
            tables and my bones when I hugged myself,  <br/>
            but without your touch.  <br/><br/>

            Then came a package:  
            a radio, a Shiba carrying your perfume,  <br/>
            paintings and photos alive with your presence.  <br/><br/>

            And suddenly, I could hear you,  <br/>
            smell you, feel you—  <br/>
            and knew you were with me.<br/>
